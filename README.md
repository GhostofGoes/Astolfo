# Astolfo - Discord Presence for Windows 10
Astolfo is a framework for implementing Discord Rich Presence for
Windows 10 programs (win32) and Store Apps (UWP).

Update your Discord status with the show you're watching on the Windows 10
Microsoft Store apps for Crunchyroll, Netflix, and more!


## Usage
Requires Python 3.6+ ([link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/))
```cmd
pipenv sync
python .\astolfo.py
```

## Project Status
Currently, I am working on support for Crunchyroll and Funimation, with
goals of expanding it to Netflix, Rooster Teeth, and others in the future.

Currently "supported" apps:
* Funimation
* Crunchyroll
* Netflix
* Windows Media Player


**WARNING: this is still very much in the "Alpha" phase.**
All you're going to get right now is the fact you have the
Crunchyroll/Funimation app open. There's still plenty of work to
be done on reverse engineering these apps, Funimation especially.
