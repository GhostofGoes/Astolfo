# Astolfo - Discord Presence for Windows 10
![Watching an Episode](https://i.imgur.com/KzBivUm.png)

Update your Discord status with the show you're watching on the Windows 10
Microsoft Store apps for Funimation, Crunchyroll, and more!

Currently, I am working on support for Crunchyroll and Funimation, with
goals of expanding it to Netflix, Rooster Teeth, and others in the future.


**WARNING: this is still very much in the "Alpha" phase.** All you're going to get
right now is the fact you have the Crunchyroll/Funimation app open.
There's still plenty of work to be done on reverse engineering these
apps, Funimation especially.

If you're willing to help in this
endeavour, open a issue or ping me on the
[Python Discord server](https://discord.gg/python) (@KnownError).


## Usage
Requires Python 3.6+ ([link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/))
```cmd
python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
python .\astolfo.py
```
