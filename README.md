# Project Status

**THIS PROJECT IS NOT IN A WORKING STATE AND IS NOT BEING ACTIVELY DEVELOPED**

Where things are at:
* Funimation has removed their Windows 10 app.
* Little progress has been made on RE'ing Crunchyroll's app to the point of extracting episode information.
* PyPresence (used to update Discord status) is potentially not reliable or even working due to (very very unfortunate) changes to the Discord client. This is 100% Discord's fault, go yell at them, maybe they'll actually listen (unlikely).

If you want to revive this, dig through some of the notes in the repo. Some work has been done on Crunchyroll and Netflix.
